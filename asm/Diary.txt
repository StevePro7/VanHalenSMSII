Today, I had asm 50 all complete prior so clone to 60 and redid with sections
although I got the FIX_REFERENCE error which solved by ensure that NO labels
start with underscore

Only problem is wrapping code in .section cause the error with the INCLUDE_SECTTIONS
which seemed to be OK for 60_bak i.e. assembled full code BUT does not work
i.e.
the timing is broken and loads graphics weird

60_bak
need to change 
jp init
jp init2

So I compromised today with 60 which is a clone of 50 but with all the underscores
removed from all the labels - this assembles OK and works fine but cannot debug
step thru the code

I noticed that some earlier versions could not debug step thru code



The other thing that I did today was
VanHalenIII
asm

the first cut debug steps thru ALOT of code but not all of it disassembles

NB:
you can always use ConTEXT as before but this is pure disassembly from Emulicious
ideally the goal is to write ASM and debug step thru all the ASM perfectly
