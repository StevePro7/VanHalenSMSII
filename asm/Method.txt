01.
Build entire project WITHOUT output.map 
dev folder
output.sms



10
create folder
copy output.sms from dev folder here
open output.sms into Emulicious
debugger

Ctrl+A to copy n' paste all disassembled output to ASM file
output.asm

IMPORTANT
if there is "extra" disassembly
i.e.
; This disassembly was created using Emulicious (http://www.emulicious.net)

occurs more than once then delete everything from the second entry to the end
i.e.
only keep first section



15
create folder
copy output.sms and output.asm from previous step
run BinaryFileWrite utility
copy 2x files across
e.g.
VH02.asm
VH02.sms

run utility to generate data folder and main.asm
save


20
create folder
copy contents of 15 to 20
rename output to Xoutput
e.g.
Xoutput.asm
Xoutput.sms

copy .vscode with launch.json and tasks.json here
copy build.bat and build.sh here

Ctrl+Shift+B
build => output.sms


02.

25
Build entire project WITH output.map 
dev folder
output.sms
output.map

dump output.sms into Emulicious
Ctrl+A to copy n' paste all disassembled output to ASM file
output.asm

IMPORTANT
here don't worry about "incbin..." as we are only using the symbols to integrate the next step
i.e.
port labels from 25/output.asm back into 20/output.asm => 30/output.asm


30
Merge

clone 25\output.asm to 25\steven.asm
copy  25\output.sms to compare util

Tortoise merge
compare
25\steven.asm
30\main.asm

update all the labels and variables from 25 to 30
